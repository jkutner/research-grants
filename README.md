# Heroku Research Grants

This is where Research Grant ideas go to get funded.

## Proposing a Research Grant

1. Copy the `PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md` to a new file in the `proposals/` directory.
2. Open a PR and follow the instructions.
3. Your proposal will be scheduled for a short 5 minute presentation.

## FAQ

### What is a Research Grant?

Research grants are time-boxed projects that allow individuals to step away from their team responsibilities for a period of time to pursue specific research goals. Research grants align with our [V2MOM methods](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/04/how-to-create-alignment-within-your-company.html) and business goals.

### How do Research Grants work?

If you have an idea for a research grant, follow these steps:

1. Create a proposal by opening a Pull Request.
1. The Research Grant committee will schedule the proposal for the next available session.
1. Present the proposal at a monthly session followed by Q&A.
1. A proposal will be funded if the following conditions are met:
    1. A Sponsor volunteers to oversee the research
    1. Majority vote from the Research Grant committee
    1. A Researcher agrees to work on the project (the Researcher may or may not be the Author)

Once a research grant has been funded, the sponsor and researcher will schedule the project with the researcher's direct manager.

* Constraints
    * No more than 1 active researcher per team
    * More than 1 researcher can collaborate on a proposal, as long as it stays within above constraints
* Preparation
    * Discuss timing with your squad and only kick off a research grant if the timing works with your squad (ie: your absence will not jeopardize the team's [OKRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR))
        * Researchers are free to withdraw from normal squad activities during the length of their grant
    * You are encouraged to swap on-call primary/secondary duties if an on-call shift overlaps with your research
    * Notify the broader org that you're kicking off the research grant and share the doc containing the details.
* Execution
    * The researcher and the sponsor will determine a schedule with milestones for the project.
    * The researcher will conduct regular check-ins with the project sponsor.
    * The sponsor will ensure that the project aligns with our [V2MOM methods](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/04/how-to-create-alignment-within-your-company.html).
    * The project will be completed within a predetermined time period (see Unresolved Questions).
    * The Research Grant Oversight Committee will hold the sponsor responsible for alignment with [V2MOM methods](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/04/how-to-create-alignment-within-your-company.html).

Upon completing a research grant project, or exhausting the funding, the following will happen:

* The Researcher and Sponsor will organize findings in a shareable format (doc, slides or screencast).
* The Researcher and Sponsor will schedule a time to present the findings at Town Hall.
* The Research Grant Oversight Committee will vote on the outcome of the research. The options include:
    * Form a new project based on the research and try to get it prioritized and staffed
    * Conduct a follow-up research grant to get more information or try a different solution
    * The research is discarded and we decide not to pursue the idea further. This option should be considered undesirable, and a retrospective must be conducted.

## Definitions

* *Project*: a funded Research Grant.

* *Research Grant Oversight Committee*: a group that organizes and votes on proposals.
